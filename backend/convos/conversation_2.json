    "content": "Hello! I understand we're embarking on a project to develop an advanced AI system, starting with building a minimal, end-to-end LangChain application. This will serve as both a learning exercise and a foundational step towards more complex development.\n\nGiven your background in economics and basic programming skills, I recommend we start by clearly defining our initial goals and approach. Specifically, I'd like to understand:\n\n1. What specific problem or use case are you looking to solve with this LangChain application?\n2. What is your current level of familiarity with Python, LangChain, and AI development frameworks?\n3. Do you have a particular domain or type of interaction you want this application to support?\n\nOur strategy will be to:\n- Start with the absolute minimal viable product\n- Ensure you understand each component deeply\n- Use LLMs as development aids, not black-box solutions\n- Build incrementally with clear learning objectives\n\nI'm here to guide you through this process, provide direct feedback, and help you develop robust software engineering skills alongside your AI development goals. What are your initial thoughts?"

In my previous message, I outlined a strategic approach to developing a minimal LangChain application, focusing on creating a foundational project that would help you learn and grow in AI development. \n\nI suggested we start by clarifying:\n1. The specific problem or use case for the application\n2. Your current programming and AI development skills\n3. The domain or type of interaction you want to support\n\nThe key points were to:\n- Create a minimal viable product\n- Ensure deep understanding of each component\n- Use AI tools as development aids, not black boxes\n- Build incrementally with clear learning objectives\n\nWould you like to discuss those initial project goals in more detail? I'm ready to help you take the first steps in developing your AI application."

Confirm LangChain is in requirements.txt\n2. Review `system_prompt.txt` for clear, precise instructions\n3. Validate `minimal_chatbot.py` implements basic conversational logic\n\nQuick Clarifying Questions:\n- What specific conversational capabilities are you targeting?\n- Have you already implemented the core chatbot logic?\n- Are you using OpenAI, Hugging Face, or another LLM backend?\n\nWould you like me to help you review and refine any specific component of this project structure?
