This will serve as both a learning exercise and a foundational step towards more complex development.\n\nGiven your background in economics and basic programming skills, I recommend we start by clearly defining our initial goals and approach. Specifically, I'd like to understand:\n\n1. What specific problem or use case are you looking to solve with this LangChain application?\n2. What is your current level of familiarity with Python, LangChain, and AI development frameworks?\n3. Do you have a particular domain or type of interaction you want this application to support?\n\nOur strategy will be to:\n- Start with the absolute minimal viable product\n- Ensure you understand each component deeply\n- Use LLMs as development aids, not black-box solutions\n- Build incrementally with clear learning objectives\n\nI'm here to guide you through this process, provide direct feedback, and help you develop robust software engineering skills alongside your AI development goals. What are your initial thoughts?"
